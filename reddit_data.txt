I have prepared a lot for the interview and I thought I was ready but I got too distracted by the people who were lining up beside the window where I was assigned to; they can hear our conversation which made me so anxious and I wasn\u2019t expecting that would happen.\n\n(For context: I\u2019m from the Philippines. I took a bachelor\u2019s degree in physical therapy and I\u2019m planning to pursue an associate\u2019s degree in business in Los Angeles City College (community college) because my goal is to build a rehab center in my hometown. I know this is a red flag, but I\u2019ve done a lot of research and even consulted with a former visa officer that there\u2019s still a chance for you to get approved as long as you\u2019re able to convince the VO about your real intent for getting a student visa.)\n\nSo I scheduled for another interview in the hopes that I\u2019d be able to speak with much more confidence this time. I wasn\u2019t expecting that I would be asked the same questions I received in my first interview. This is how it went:\n\nVO: Good morning! Where do you intend to go?\nMe: In Los Angeles, particularly to study in Los Angeles City College (I wanted to give more details and start explaining why I wanna study there but I was afraid she\u2019ll just cut me off and get annoyed like what my first interviewer did)\nVO: What do you plan on studying there?\nMe: I want to take a 2-year associate\u2019s degree in business (Again, I want to explain more but I\u2019m afraid of giving much details that she didn\u2019t even ask for)\nVO: Who will be your sponsor?\nMe: My cousin who is a US citizen will be the one to finance my education. She works as a game producer at the Riot Games company where she earns a salary of $xxx,xxx and she agreed to sponsor me with her savings. She also offered me a stay in her apartment which is just a 30-min drive away from the school which is convenient for me. She\u2019s gonna provide me everything that I need once I get there.\nVO: What\u2019s the highest education you attained?\nMe: I took a 5-year bachelor\u2019s degree in physical therapy and during those first two years I was consistently the top of our batch where I have received a full refund of my tuition as a reward. I finished my studies in June 2020 and I took the board exam in Dec 2021 which I successfully passed so now I\u2019m a licensed physiotherapist.\n\n(The 1st and 2nd VO literally asked me the exact same questions, and I didn\u2019t even get the chance to explain why I want to pursue business, what my post-graduation goals are, my ties to the country, etc etc.)\n\nVO: You know that you were denied previously right in your first interview right?\nMe: Yes ma\u2019am\nVO: I\u2019m sorry but I really can\u2019t approve your visa *hands me the blue paper*\nMe: I\u2019m aware I was denied the first time because I wasn\u2019t able to properly answer a question, but now I wanna take this chance to explain myself better if you would allow me.\nVO: Go ahead\nMe: The reason why I want to study business is because I really want to put a rehabilitation center in my hometown because there\u2019s a need for it. There\u2019s only a limited number of physical therapists back there because of less hiring opportunities and so due to the lack of job prospects, fewer physical therapists are choosing to work in my hometown. As a result, physical therapy services are not really available in my community, so I really wanna do my best to fill that gap and pursue my passion while helping the people back in my hometown.\nVO: I understand your reason but I\u2019m sorry.

{"title": "Post-Completion OPT Application Timing Advice from an Elder: There is almost never a good reason to choose to delay your own OPT application. Be prepared. Apply as close to the USCIS allowed application acceptance date as possible.", "text": "Background: I've been working with international students for over two decades. Recent changes in group decision making regarding OPT application timing among a large portion of students seems less than helpful to their own OPT applications. My experience and perspective on OPT goes beyond one or two application cycles. Here is my personal advice when considering your OPT application timing options. \n\nPrior to 2023, most students completing study in May would have been lined up to get their OPT applications to USCIS in February. This was the trend for many, many years prior to 2023. Which was the smart thing to do.\n\nSuddenly in 2023, in some mass common decision that can only come from bad advice/information floating around on Reddit or some Whatapp group, many students started choosing to delay their own OPT applications. And not only by a little bit, but changing years of practice of applying in February to instead largely applying in late March and in April.\n\nSome reasons to consider being well-prepared to make timely and early applicants for OPT with USCIS: \n\n1. USCIS processing time vary widely. The time it took for applicants who applied last week is very likely to be different than the timeline of outcomes for those who apply next week. You cannot predict USCIS timelines. I cannot predict USCIS timelines. Trying to do so is folly. The best way to protect yourself from that is get your application to them as early as they allow. Then, you can sit back and relax instead of spending time stressing out about whether or not your OPT will be approved \"on time.\" USCIS OPT processing times over the last two decades have typically fallen somewhere between two and four months. Sometimes they've been faster than that (lucky times!). Sometimes they've taken longer than that. Three or four months is not a delay by USCIS; it's pretty standard.\n2. Things can and do go wrong with applications to USCIS. Your application could be missing something. Documents may not upload appropriately. USCIS may look at your application and want to know more information and pause your application while they send to you an RFE. Your OPT may get approved but then your EAD gets lost in the mail which usually take many weeks if not months sometimes to get replaced (and your employer won't let you start working until they see your EAD as proof of employment authorization). Being well-prepared and applying early gives you more time to deal with those things if they happen. Delaying your own application means reducing your time to deal with such things if they happen.\n3. You want to wait to ask your academic advisor and DSO for information/documents for OPT (such as the OPT I-20) at the same time all of the continuing students want to also ask them for summer CPT and summer travel signatures? Sounds like a great way to slow down your own application steps (as well as summer CPT requests for continuing students). Also, it seems likely USCIS might get busier around March and April with H-1B processing. \n\nAs noted, USCIS processing times are widely unpredictable. However, there was a very clear pattern both of the last two semesters (this is written in early March 2024). With student choices this year, it seems very likely the same will happen again this semester.\n\n1. For May 2023 graduates, OPT applicants applying in February and very early March were getting OPT application decisions back in anywhere from one to six weeks from application. Guess what? So far in 2024 the same thing is happening.\n2. For May 2023 graduates, OPT applications submitted in late March and April took *months*, not weeks, for review. Often times taking between 3 and 4 months. Then there was much panic as students wanting to start working who decided to delay their own OPT application timing resulted in them not getting their OPT approvals/EADs by the dates they wanted to start working. A lost EAD in the mail? Something with plenty of time to fix when it is lost in March becomes a huge problem when it was issued and lost in July and the student is already building days of OPT unemployment.\n\nThere was a very similar pattern for Fall 2023. Well-prepared students who applied in September and early October? Fast OPT decisions. Those who delayed until late October, November, or December? Mostly taking months for OPT application review by USCIS.\n\nWhoever started students choosing to delay their own applications by some Whatsapp or Reddit \"advising\" deserves a class action lawsuit for spreading such bad advice. \n\nExcept for some very individual and unique situations, my advice is then apply early. My personal advice is that the best way to be best prepared as a May graduate is to have your OPT application to USCIS by February of that same year. Didn't get that done this year as a May graduate? Take steps now to get that submitted ASAP. Don't make a decision to delay your own application; delaying is more likely going to create problems for you than taking timely action would.

The job market was also bad in 00\u2019 and 08\u2019 but there weren\u2019t so many international students back then. The only valid reason I can think of is that by applying closer to the end of grace period they are hoping that USCIS review their case later than the end of their grace period and consequently give them a start date later than what originally could have been their latest start date. For example  student\u2019s grace period ends on 7/11, they apply on 7/10 and uscis review their case on 8/1. Under this scenario uscis may give them a start date of 8/1.

So we have to do our honors thesis and that usually requires instructor consent, so I enrolled in a class for that on Friday for next fall and that can be done before the enrollment period. But I will be adding more classes next week when enrollment officially begins. I noticed tonight that my university account was showing part time which didn't make any sense to me so I looked and noticed that was the reason. I have sent an email to the DSO explaining my situation and even attached a screenshot showing the discrepancy. This won't affect my status will it.

{"title": "F1 visa renewal experience (Hyderabad VAC)", "text": "I obtained my F1 visa in June 2019 for a master's program, and after graduation, I transitioned to a different university for my Ph.D. My visa was set to expire in June 2024. \n\nTo renew it, I completed a new DS160 on https://ceac.state.gov/ceac/ and created a new account on USTravelDocs.com. I paid the required $ 185 fee, but there was no need to pay any SEVIS fee as I already had an active SEVIS record. On USTravelDocs, I discovered an option to check if I qualified for a visa interview waiver. After answering a few questions, I received the reassuring message: *Congratulations! You are eligible for the Interview Waiver*. This discovery brought some relief, as it meant I only needed to schedule a \"drop-box appointment\" to submit my documents, and I did not need to schedule a visa interview at the U.S. Embassy/Consulate.\n\nInitially, I wanted an appointment in Hyderabad, but the only option available was Chennai at the time of making this appointment (January 28, 2024). However, I was later relieved to learn that the appointment location didn't matter. Regardless of the appointment location, I was allowed to drop off my documents at any VAC (Visa Application Center). For the delivery type option to receive the passport back with the visa, I chose 'pickup' to avoid relying on the vagaries of the postal service. For the pickup, I decided on the Hyderabad option. **My drop-off and pickup locations were at the VAC inside the Hitec City metro station.**\n\nI took many things to my VAC appointment (out of an abundance of caution). But you only need a passport (which already has the F1 visa, the one you're trying to renew), I-20, DS-160 appointment confirmation, the drop-box appointment confirmation, and a photograph. \n\nI got the specifications for the picture on the USTravelDocs website: \"One photograph (as per U.S. visa photograph specifications - https://ustraveldocs.com/in/en/step-2#photos-and-fingerprints)\". \n\nI also had proof of employment (as a graduate student researcher), my transcripts, the SEVIS payment record from the first time, etc., which, in retrospect, seems very unnecessary!\n\nIt's essential to ensure your photos meet the requirements (see above). I had my photos taken at a FedEx in the U.S. before my travel to India, but at the VAC counter, they said it didn't quite meet the requirements and asked me to get one retaken. There are a couple of places to take this photo right where the VAC is. You need to ask for a 'visa' photo; they know what to give you. Although the new picture I got taken there (which got accepted) looked basically the same, specifications wise, as the one I got from FedEx. But given how stressful the whole process was (in my head lol), I didn't want to argue, and the 200 rupees or so I spent was the sacrifice I was okay making (not that I had a choice haha).\n\nThe appointment itself is chill\u2014you enter the metro station, and you'll be guided by the VAC staff to get into the line. You need to make sure you have the appointment confirmation printed and ready. My appointment time was March 8, 10:15 AM (called \"OFC appointment time\") in Chennai, but as I said, the city doesn't matter, and you can drop it off at other places, like Hyderabad in my case. They tell you they will let you in ONLY at your appointment time. Still, at least on the day I went, I was allowed to go to the counter some 45 minutes or so before my actual appointment time of 10:15 AM>\n\nThe drop-box appointment itself was a straightforward process that took about 10 minutes (excluding the quick run to get the photo taken). They took my documents and gave me back my appointment confirmation page with a stamp (it says VISA application Center March 8, 2024, Hyderabad), presumably as a record that my passport was submitted.\n\nNext, the wait began!\n\nI had planned this trip to India for over three weeks to meet family and get the visa renewed. There are two ways to track visa status. One on the USTravelDocs website itself\u2014which for me said \"passport status: Delivered to post\" a day or two after my appointment and just stayed like that for the rest of the month (23 days or so)..the other way to check is on ceac.state.gov/ceac. I checked CEAC on the 25th or so (I didn't think to check CEAC until then), and it just said \"application received.\" Case created: March 20, 2024, and last updated March 24, 2024.\n\nI had my tickets booked for my return to the U.S. on March 27 and was filled with nervous anticipation the whole time since I heard back nothing.\n\nI reached out many times to their call center, and while almost always responsive, they were not too helpful. I don't blame them, but I was frustrated that there was no one I could reach out to and explain that I am a Ph.D. student with research deadlines that need me to return on a specific date. Plus, what was particularly frustrating is that each time I spoke to a representative, I got a different answer about the wait time: 7-14 days, 7-14 ***business*** days, one month...etc., which was annoying. \n\nI also contacted them via the feedback/requests tab on USTravelCocs around three times during the 3-4 week period after drop off, explaining my situation and begging them to expedite the process. I always got prompt responses within the same day or the next. But the upshot of them all was: *sorry, you have to wait.* This lack of proper communication channels was a major source of frustration during my renewal process.\n\nI ended up having to reschedule my flights. Then, on April 3 at 3:30 PM, I got a text saying my passport was ready for pickup. But I couldn't go since the VAC is 1.5 hours away from my location in Hyderabad and closes at 4 PM. So I went to collect it the following morning.\n\nTo get into the line for passport pickup, they asked me for a printout/photocopy of my I.D. like Aadhaar or passport, which, again, I didn't have on me since they didn't mention it in the message that said the passport was ready. It may have been mentioned elsewhere, but I didn't know/think to look. I happened to have a picture of my passport on my phone, so I got that printed and signed it (remember to carry a pen) and put my Indian phone number, email, and name on it. I gave it to them, and they gave me my passport back.\n\nAnd I got my visa extended until March 2029.\n\nOverall, the experience can differ depending on when and where you undergo this process. I have had friends undergo the F1 renewal process at about the same time as me, and, apparently, it took one of them two weeks (in December 2023 at the Mumbai VAC) and the other, four weeks at the Kolkata VAC.\n\nI hope this helps you.\n\nGood luck!\n\n", "comments": [{"text": "Hello!

{"title": "Switch schools with Day 1 CPT", "text": "Hello everyone, I am currently on my OPT post bachelors, and the expiration date on my OPT is July 7th. The company I am working for sponsored me for the H1B but unfortunately I did not get lucky, and now I am a bit stressed because this job is very important for me and I do not want to miss this great opportunity.\n\nAfter finding that I did not get the H1B, I have taken steps to help the situation, and I have applied and already been admitted to a masters at a school only 30 minutes away (lets call it school X). School X will do Day 1 CPT and the classes are at night, which do not create any time conflict with work so everything is perfect. The only problem is that the masters starts in the Fall (August 26th), and I would not be able to work from July 7th to August 26th. The only solution that I found to that is enrolling in another school (School Y) that is 2 hours away and allows me to start in the summer term and do a summer internship (which would be my current job) because it is part of the coursework. That would also be my only summer class so I would not even have actual class to attend. The idea would be to transfer from Y to X after the summer term.\n\nSo the question is, would it be possible to enroll in the school Y, do the summer internship, then transfer to the school X for the fall semester and do the Day 1CPT? That way there would not be gaps in my authorization to work. My concern is whether it is allowed to transfer the SEVIS profile twice in such a small timeframe (from my undergrad, to school Y in May that let me do summer internship, and then to school X in August where I intend to do day 1 CPT).\n\nI know it is a mess, but I am scared that in the first scenario where I am unable to work from July 7th to August 26th my company might just let me go. I will also talk to school X and see if I could do an internship in the summer as it is part of the coursework, just like school Y lets me do.\n\nFYI, I do not plan on staying in the US after completing the masters, so there is no intention of doing post masters OPT, which could potentially be revoked after all these changes.\n\nPlease share your opinions and if you know of any other options to help the situation please feel free to share it!", "comments": [{"text": "Not sure if it will be that fast to transfer school, considering how slow everything here is", "author": "superkjs0910"}, {"text": "Right, I agree, but I think transferring the SEVIS profile from one school to another only takes 1-2 business days.", "author": "fvlanz1"}]}

My partner plans on continuing practicing in home country once we return, and plans on keeping the licenses and the necessary registrations for it), and in the long run, we plan on returning, for many reasons.

If my spouse applies for F2 sometime before/right after we get married and faces an interview in August/September 2024, and the visa gets approved, and then I apply for OPT immediately afterwards (assuming the OPT gets approved), will there be any difficulty for my spouse entering the US when they come to join me in January 2025 ?\n2.

A little context: I am a second year PhD student in Biomedical Sciences in the US. I am at a point in my life where I am struggling financially severely due to extreme family circumstances. My mom (lives back in the Middle East where I am from) has cancer and her insurance won\u2019t cover it so I have to give her money every month to help pay for the treatments. When I first moved to the US because i had no credit history i had to pay an insane amount for a security deposit plus 2 months rent upfront which left me with $5000 in credit card debt now. I live with two roommates now and have a fairly low rent but still can\u2019t pay off my debt because my stipend is just not enough. \n\nSo I am applying for $7000 loan from Mpower to payoff my credit cards and be able to send some money to my mom that would cover the rest of her treatments.

", "comments": [{"text": "Hey there,\n\nI am a F1 student currently on OPT, so I believe I can answer your question.\n\nA visa is simply a document that allows you to enter the US. It has no bearing once you've stepped foot in US soil. What determines whether you are legally staying in the US is your \"F1 Status\". \n\nSo, no, you do not need to renew your F1 student visa in order to legally stay in the US. You'd only need it if you need to travel internationally and need to present it to CBP officers at the port of entry (there is a notable exception of being allowed to travel on an expired F1 visa to Canada and Mexico for 30 days or less as well!)\n\nTo answer your next question, yes, your I-20 does have a program end date which will be the date you formally graduate from your university. The good news is that your I-20 remains valid even beyond the program's end date to stay in F1 Status as long as you are in OPT/STEM OPT. \n\nIf you had entered the US by air, you have an electronic I-94 in which there is an expiry date which is the date by which you need to leave the United States. For students such as you and I, if you go ahead and check it at the I-94 website, it should list \"D/S\" (Duration of Status) which basically means that you can stay for as long as you're a student, on OPT, STEM OPT, etc. \n\nSo, this should cover the \"legally staying portion\" of your query. \n\nAs for applying to OPT, yes you'd be issued a new form I-20 with OPT recommendation by your university's DSO. Make sure you get this recommendation before filling out the OPT application on the USCIS website (form I-765). \n\nMy man, I'd also recommend getting in touch with international advisors on your university to get these answers instead of relying on random redditors such as myself for these highly important queries, and make sure to follow their guidance properly while filling out your OPT.\n\nLastly, congratulations on the job! \ud83c\udf89", "author": "Bipal"}, {"text": "Will need a bit more information regarding your visa, why does it expire in june, is this not your fist opt?", "author": "Elite_warrior04"}, {"text": "An expired F1 will not harm your chances of H1b.\nYour program dates on your i20 won\u2019t change but once you apply for opt, you will have work authorization on page 2 of your i20.

Now, I can explain the connection very easily based on my research work in biological sample analysis and optimization of processes included in my thesis, but it is not as obviously connected with EEB.

Though maybe this is a good reason to not apply for a new F-1 visa when your current one has plenty of time left on it.\n\nAs a reminder to other F-1 students, the expiration date of the F-1 visa has nothing to do with how long you can remain inside of the US in F-1 status. Your F-1 visa is simply used to show at the US border/port of entry to request to enter the US in F-1 status. Once you are inside the US in F-1 status, the F-1 visa sticker and its expiration date are both completely irrelevant to how long you can remain inside the US in F-1 status. There is then no reason to depart the US for the purpose of just applying for a new F-1 visa. The only time you really need to apply for a new F-1 visa is if you choose to travel outside the US, and your chosen return date is after your current F-1 visa expires. Then you have to apply for a new one as you need a valid F-1 visa to request to re-enter the US again to resume your F-1 status.\n\nYour F-1 status stay in the US is determined by the end date of your program of study/OPT end date plus the 60 day grace period regardless of what is printed on the F-1 visa stamp/sticker.\n\nEdit: Oh, and the answer is, you need to ask this question of the US embassy/consulate that issued the visas.", "author": "GRRAWorld"}, {"text": "[deleted]", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"text": "Even though they didn't put the cancellation stamp on your old visa, they might have cancelled it electronically (similar to how they cancel the visa of people who are still in the US but get charged with a DUI).

You description does not make clear whether the two visas were for the same or different programs/SEVIS IDs, but since they should have CWOP'd your old visa when they issued you a new one, you would be taking a risk to try and travel on it.

However, it is not clear if I should activate my initial opt using my undergrad degree in order to be eligible for the extension and in my situation will I still be qualified for two extensions?   \nThank you!", "comments": [{"text": "No, that's not correct. No one ever qualifies for a four year OPT extension. You've got that a little confused.\n\nIf you don't use the STEM OPT extension for a degree, and you can later use that to extend another, later OPT for 24 months.\n\nFor example, you could do this:\n\n1. Complete a bachelor's degree in a STEM field\n2. Not apply for the OPT STEM extension for the bachelor's degree\n3. Complete a non-STEM master's degree.\n4. Apply for OPT for the non-STEM master's degree and work in the master's degree field of study\n5. Use the otherwise unused bachelor's degree OPT STEM extension to apply for a STEM Extension of the non-STEM master's OPT. Then you would have to switch to working in the bachelor's field of study during that 24-months of STEM OPT.\n\nSince you've done a STEM master's degree, you have one of two choices:\n\n1. Apply for the OPT STEM extension for your master's degree field (24 months)\n2. Apply for the OPT STEM extension for the bachelor's degree field  (24 months).\n\nYou CANNOT apply for the OPT STEM extension for both. You need to pick one or the other, and that maximum will be 24 months. Not 48 months.\n\nEdit: Your post-completion OPT for your bachelor's degree is gone forever. You can only apply for post-completion OPT (what many students are now calling initial OPT) within no more than 60 days from completing that degree. If you don't, that post-completion OPT is gone forever. \n\nYou can now apply for post-completion OPT for the master's degree. You can choose whether you apply for the 24-month extension of that OPT by using your bachelor's degree or master's degree field.", "author": "GRRAWorld"}, {"text": "You may not do this.

Or you could just apply for a STEM doctoral degree and apply for the doctoral post-completion OPT and the OPT STEM extension using the doctoral field of study.

You only get up to two times for the OPT STEM extension.", "author": "GRRAWorld"}, {"text": "I understand, I'm a DSO.

FOR SOMEONE WHO APPLIED THREE WEEKS AFTER YOU DID, USCIS MAY BE TAKING THREE MONTHS TO PROCESS THOSE APPLICATIONS.\n\nIt is very common for USCIS to be processing applications within a few weeks and then suddenly start taking three months or more to process applications. THIS IS NORMAL.\n\nDo not expect the same processing times as someone who applied three weeks before you did. The people who apply three weeks after you should not be planning their life around getting the same processing time as you received.\n\nWhat you should NOT expect is that USCIS processing times will stay the same. They will not.\n\nAgain, the best way to protect yourself from this USCIS processing time chaos is for you to take timely action to apply as early as USCIS will accept your OPT application. Taking timely action to apply early should almost certainly save you from having to pay an additional $1685 for premium processing.\n\nThe later you apply, the more likely you will have problems. The more likely you won't have your EAD when you want it. You have less time to deal with any questions/RFE's from USCIS. If your EAD gets lost in the mail, which happens not infrequently, you have less time to request and receive a replacement.\n\nApply early.

My Google AdSense account is linked to my Pakistani address, and the payment account is under my brother's name and is based in Pakistan. Upon arriving in the USA, I needed to update my country location on my Gmail account to access certain features like downloading apps from the Play Store. Consequently, my Google payment account now shows two profiles, one corresponding to Pakistan and the other to the USA, both under the same name but with different IDs. However, the payment method and account information remain associated with my Pakistani ID.\n\nI have been receiving approximately $100 or more annually in YouTube ad earnings, which are transferred to my brother's bank account in Pakistan via Google AdSense.

I was active in the job market from May 2023 to oct 2023, and got just 2 interviews after applying for ~300-400 applications, cold emailing, reaching out etc. Have given up since then.

I applied over 1500 positions for about a year only got 30ish interviews. And my current job isn\u2019t even from job application. My advice is keep cold applying jobs daily, spend sometime to do some projects that you can show off on your resume, spam on LinkedIn for coffee chat/networking/referral, ask around if you can get referrals from friends or friends of friends, attend career fair at school if you can (I got my job by doing this, wasn\u2019t expecting it at all), last but not least, spare sometime for entertainment and exercise and relax. your health is more important than anything.", "author": "Informal_Produce996"}, {"text": "How did you give up in between?

Secondly, networking is an ongoing process. Talk to as many people as you can, to ensure when there are right opportunities at XYZ firms, you already have connections there, who will be willing to push your application. I would highly recommend to look away from transactional relationships. And lastly, get a mentor for yourself. You will always find someone who'll be willing to help you grow.

I was detained for hours at the border (trying to re-enter the US) and almost deported because the CBP officer didn\u2019t even fully know the correct laws regarding this process. That experience still remains one of the most traumatic memories of my life, and I\u2019m pretty sure the only reason I was let back in is because I was traveling with my US Citizen partner at the time, and he was there with me while I was detained. Be prepared with every document, every detail, and do this process as soon as you can. I was out of status from November 2019 to February 2020 (because it took a while for me to get a Canadian tourist visa), and I don\u2019t advise anyone to wait longer than that.

This finding of status violation by the DHS, an IJ, or the BIA will cause a period of \"unlawful presence\" to begin.  In DOS cases where DHS or an IJ or the BIA makes a formal status violation finding, the individual begins accruing unlawful presence on the day after the finding (i.e., the date the finding was published /communicated).  For example, if an applicant presents a letter from DHS dated December 1, 2008, that says the applicant was out of status starting on May 28, 2001, the applicant began to accrue unlawful presence as of December 2, 2008, not May 28, 2001.", "author": "DEANatVISAS101dotCOM"}, {"text": "When it comes to visa denials, much depends on your nationality, funding and school. \nIf you are from Germany, going to do phd at Harvard on full scholarship - you have nothing to worry about.\nIf you are from Vietnam or Syria (low visa approval rate countries) going to a fly-by-night 'language school' for which you have to pay full price - your records will be scrutinized.\n\nProbably you are somewhere in between.
